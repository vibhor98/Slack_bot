# Slack_bot
This Slack bot is an interactive and helpful bot. Using Slack's Real Time Messaging API, this bot notifies all the messages in which the user is mentioned or tagged and can even reply for most of the messages appropriately. 

Contains three files - 
1. `discover.py` checks whether the bot is working or not. Moreover, it tells us the id of our bot associated with the slack.
2. `vibhor_bot.py` starts the bot.
3. `source.sh` contains all the api tokens.
4. `lang_translator.py` translates the script into any language specified by the user. Works on the google translator module named as `googletrans`. It is one of the best features that gives the user a sense of multilinguality. It is highly beneficial for the professionals having trouble in speaking local languages.
5. `Scrabble.py` integrates scrabble helper to the Slack bot. It helps the user in getting all the valid words from the given rack of words. Thus, it helps the user to play and win the mind game- Scrabble.
